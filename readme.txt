<h4>What is retargeting?</h4>

When someone visits your web site and doesn't sign up or convert, we place an anonymous cookie in their browser that lets us serve them ads later on Facebook or across a network of more than 100,000+ web sites.  When they see these ads, it reminds them about your business and they come back and convert.  Think of it like a second chance to reach lost customers.
